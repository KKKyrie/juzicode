# Intro
- A code-sharing platform
- A mini project in LEX)N

## Stack
- Vue / Vue-router (yes, no vuex)  
- PHP (which I didn't push)  
- Mysql  

## Hint 4 U :)
1. Can't run, so do not try to clone it and run some bash like ```npm install``` or ```npm run build```, it cannot run with back-end.  If u ask me why not use json-server or something like that (RESTful), sorry dude, just because this project had been shut down and I find it meaningless to add a REST api only for u be able to run it.  
2. If u find some code is just like **a piece of shit**, don't blame me, they are not written by me :)  
3. If I had time, I would **refactor the code** in the way I prefer. It couldn't be better that U make some PR to this repository.
